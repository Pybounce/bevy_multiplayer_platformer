// Data and Visual Grid Generics

// Have a system Query<Grid<T>, GridVisualisor<T>> where T : GridObject + VisualGridObject
// Then I can deal with visuals that way
// And also have a system Query<Grid<T>> where T : GridObject
// Dealing with only data, ignorinhg visuals



//------------------
// Issue with events
// You create 3 events fine
// Then you press undo and it moves the pointer to the second newest event
// Press undo again, moves pointer to 3rd newest
// Then create a new event, it would wipe any event above the pointer out
// This loss of data makes it hard for external places to make their way to most recent

//--------------------------------------------------------//

// POSSIBLE COOKING
// What if the Grid component only held data, that's it
// Then the GridView component, displayed any data the Grid component was holding
// No idea how this works but fuck I like it
// If the Grid holds some events with an incrementing id, the GridView can keep track of which ones it has processed
// However, will the GridView use the events, given that the gridData will be out of date from the specific it looks at (unless it maintains it's own griddata?)
// The GridView can use events to work out what tiles are dirty, and then only ever display the most recent
// The GridView will need to read things like resize events too

//--------------------------------------------------------//


// what the fuck am I doing
// Does the grid just track entities and data, and completely replace them? even with an atlas change? it's just
//  BOOP and it deletes and spawns?
// HOW DOES THIS WORK FOR FUCK SAKE??


//Ok so what if the GridObject trait was implemented by an enum
// Then it could take in commands
// It could have an insert function (since remove will just delete the entity, can be done anywhere)
// The insert function takes in the data of it, and returns an entity
// So I raise events with the GridObject in them, then it runs through and calls insert(gridObject)
//      It takes the returned entity and inserts it into the hashmap, along with the gridObject
//      The hashmap becomes HashMap<GridPos, (Entity, GridObject)>
// As for the ground, the insert function could also take in the current HashMap, where it could match the gridobjects and work out the correct atlas
// I'm not 100% sure how it would then start creating events for the surrounding ground tiles etc
// Perhaps the insert function could also add events to the event group to happen after?


//--------------------------------------------------------//


// have a tile component
// have a tileTexture component
// in the tile component, have an entity pointing to the grid that owns the tile

// have a grid component

// each tile component will contain a get_tile_type() func and a same_type_as(TileType) to do equality checks MAYBE
// grid will have a get getneighbourbitmask(grid_pos) - which returns the 8 neighbours surrounding that position
    // 1 if they are the same type, 0 otherwise
